# STAT 8320 Group Project: Group 1-Wilson & Mills

## Original Dataset
The Moosavi et al. (2023) dataset US Accidents (2016 - 2023): A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset was analyzed for this project sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents.
The file cannot be directly loaded into this Repo due to the size of the file and limitations of GitHub. However, it can be directly downloaded through the provided link.

## Source Code
All coding was performed in Python stored in a Jupyter Notebook, however the file size is too large to store with GitHubs restrictions. The original notebook that has been fully run has been zipped and attached as STAT8320_Project.zip. Additionally, the Notebook has been converted to a .py script in place. Every seciton is commented on what was being performed. Additionally all library functions imported are consolidated at the top of the file. The file name is STAT8320_Project.py.

## Software Installation
All additional tools utilized by this project that extended beyond base python are python libraries.
If a library is used that is not installed on your system, it is recommend to PIP Install the respective library. Instructions to do so are provided here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.
